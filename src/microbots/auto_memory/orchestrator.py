    Existence alone isn't enough to trust ``repo_path``: it could be an

    reused workdir whose config now points at a different ``url``. So
    if ``repo_path`` exists, its ``origin`` remote is checked against
    ``url`` first. Only an exact match is reused as-is; anything else
    (mismatched origin, or not a git checkout at all) is removed and
    re-cloned, so training never silently runs against missing or
    wrong code.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Git URL (or local path) to clone from.

    """Run an eval task in a loop, retraining on failure until it passes.

    Memory lives in one place (``workdir/memory``) and is mutated in
    place: each round snapshots it to
    ``rounds/round_N/starting_memory_snapshot`` before the eval agent
    reads it, so what the round began with stays recoverable. The task
    then evaluates against that memory in its own
    ``rounds/round_N/eval`` directory. Passing returns immediately;
    failing feeds ``outcome.feedback`` to ``run_training``, which
    rewrites memory for the next round. Either way the round's outcome
    is written to ``result.json``.

    An eval that raises is logged and recorded as a failed outcome so
    one bad round cannot discard the rounds before it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    training_repo_path : str
        Absolute path to the persistent checkout the training agent
        reads. Separate from the eval checkout, which the task clones
        and resets itself every round.
    workdir : Path
        This run's workdir (see ``microbots.auto_memory.workdir``).
    model : str
        The model to use, in the format ``<provider>/<model_name>``.
    task : EvalTask
