# MicrobotsLogAnalyzer Azure Pipelines Task

`MicrobotsLogAnalyzer` is an Azure DevOps custom task that runs Microbots `LogAnalysisBot` against a log file. It authenticates to Azure OpenAI through an Azure Resource Manager Service Connection, creates an isolated Python venv on the build agent, installs `microbots[azure_ad]`, and prints the root-cause analysis into the pipeline logs.

## Prerequisites

- Azure DevOps organization where you can install custom extensions.
- Azure Resource Manager Service Connection with permission to request tokens for the Azure OpenAI resource. See [Azure managed identity setup](guides/azure-managed-identity-setup.md) for service connection and Azure OpenAI RBAC setup. The pipeline must be authorized to use this service connection.
- Azure Pipelines agent with `azure-cli`, `python3`, `pip` and `python3 -m venv` support. Microbots uses Docker sandboxing by default, so the agent also needs a reachable Docker-compatible daemon.
- Azure OpenAI deployment that works with Microbots and is reachable by the service connection.

## Use Azure Marketplace Extension

Install the published Marketplace extension into the Azure DevOps organization that owns your pipelines:

1. Open the Marketplace listing:
   [Microbots Log Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Microbots-log-analyzer.microbots-log-analyzer).
   You may be required to sign in to Marketplace to view the extension.
2. Select **Get it free**.
3. Choose the Azure DevOps organization where your pipelines run.
4. Confirm the extension appears in the organization extension page:
   `https://dev.azure.com/<organization>/_settings/extensions`. If it appears under the `Shared` section you need to install it to your org (requires Azure DevOps Org Admin Access)

## Use It In A Pipeline

See the complete sample pipeline at [docs/examples/azure-pipelines/microbots-log-analyzer.yml](examples/azure-pipelines/microbots-log-analyzer.yml).

```yaml
- task: MicrobotsLogAnalyzer@0
  displayName: Analyze build log
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: my-azure-service-connection
    deploymentName: my-azure-openai-deployment
    endpoint: https://my-azure-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/
    apiVersion: 2025-03-01-preview
    codebasePath: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
    logFilePath: logs/build.log
    outputFilePath: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/microbots-log-analysis.md
    additionalContext: |
      This build usually fails when package version conflicts occur.
      Please consider it while analyzing the log.
    timeoutSeconds: 600
    maxIterations: 20
```

The log file must exist before `MicrobotsLogAnalyzer@0` runs. Relative `logFilePath` values are resolved from `codebasePath`; absolute paths are also supported.

`outputFilePath` is optional. When it is provided, it must be an absolute path ending in `.txt`, `.md`, or `.log`. The file does not need to exist; the task creates missing directories and replaces any existing file content with the latest LLM analysis result.

`additionalContext` is optional. When provided, it is appended as extra user context for the log analysis and does not replace or override the Microbots system prompt. Maximum length: 1024 characters.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `azureSubscription` | Yes | - | Azure Resource Manager service connection used for Azure CLI login. Alias: `serviceConnection`. |
| `deploymentName` | Yes | - | Azure OpenAI deployment name. |
| `endpoint` | Yes | - | Azure OpenAI endpoint, for example `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/`. |
| `apiVersion` | Yes | - | Azure OpenAI API version passed to Microbots, for example `2025-03-01-preview`. |
| `codebasePath` | Yes | - | Repository or source folder Microbots can inspect while analyzing the log. |
| `logFilePath` | Yes | - | Log file path. Use an absolute path, or a relative path resolved from `codebasePath`. |
| `outputFilePath` | No | - | Absolute `.txt`, `.md`, or `.log` path where the LLM analysis result is written. Missing directories are created, and existing file contents are replaced. |
| `additionalContext` | No | - | Additional user context appended to the log analysis prompt. Maximum length: 1024 characters. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | No | `600` | Maximum time for `LogAnalysisBot.run()`. |
| `maxIterations` | No | `20` | Maximum number of Microbots iterations. Leave unset to use the default from `LogAnalysisBot.run()`. |

## How It Works

1. Azure Pipelines runs the task with the `Node20_1` task handler.
2. The task logs in with the supplied Azure Resource Manager Service Connection.
3. The task creates or reuses a virtual environment (`microbots-log-analyzer-venv`).
4. The task installs `microbots[azure_ad]` into that virtual environment.
5. A short Python runner creates `LogAnalysisBot` with `AzureCliCredential`, mounts `codebasePath` as context, passes `logFilePath`, optional `additionalContext`, optional `maxIterations`, and `timeoutSeconds` to `LogAnalysisBot.run()`, and prints the analysis result.
6. If `outputFilePath` is provided, the task writes the LLM analysis result to that file, replacing any existing contents.

The task clears the Azure CLI account at the end of the run. Its task manifest also uses Azure Pipelines command restrictions so analyzed log content cannot run arbitrary logging commands or set pipeline variables.
